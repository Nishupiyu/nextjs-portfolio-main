            Hey Piya, I love you so much. I know we both love each other deeply.
            Happy Birthday, my love. I hope you like this gift. ‚ù§Ô∏è
            Right now, while making this, I can&apos;t control my tears, Piyu, seriously.
            Like at this moment, I am crying like hell. I just love you so much.
            Maybe in the next life, I will be a better person and will be able to keep you happy.
            I am sorry for everything, Piyu, but just know that I love you more than
            anyone in this world, and I will always love you. Even if I am gone forever
            from this world, just know that I love you more than anyone. 
            Maybe I couldn&apos;t be a perfect person, but still, Happiest Birthday, my love ‚ù§Ô∏è
            Be happy always and do well in life, Piyu. And yes, baby, I wish I could have met you,
            but I think this is the end for me. I love you so much, Piyu ‚ù§Ô∏è
